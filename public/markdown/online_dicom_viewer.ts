# Overview
My online DICOM image viewer is a web application designed to display and interact with DICOM medical images directly in the browser. Utilizing modern web technologies, the application offers precise measurements and various navigational features to enhance the user experience.

# Technology Stack
## Frontend:
  - Framework: Next.js (React)
  - Styling: Tailwind CSS
  - Language: TypeScript
## Libraries:
  - cornerstone.js

# How It Works
The application leverages the cornerstone.js library to parse DICOM file header information and render the image(s) on the screen. The DICOM lump data is converted to JPEG format and then displayed with the <img> tag.

# Features
- View one or more DICOM images
- True-to-size coordinate and size tracking (e.g., converts pixels to mm based on DICOM image metadata)
- Navigate images by scrolling, arrow keys, or dragging
- True-to-size linear measurements (millimeters)

# Future Directions
- Ability for users to change views to axial, coronal, and sagittal
- Improved measuring mechanisms with additional shapes
- Enhanced contrast adjustment
- Joystick improvement
- Local storage history tracking
- Upgrade cornerstone library and other helpers to the latest version

# Testing Data
DICOM images sourced from platforms like Kaggle and dicomlibrary.com.
